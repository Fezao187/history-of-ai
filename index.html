					<h1>What is AI?</h1>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p><strong>Artificial Inteligence</strong> is a field of computer science focused on creating
						systems
						that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. <br />Such as:</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<ul>
						<li> <strong>Understanding language </strong>(natural language processing, chatbots,
							translation)</li>
						<li class="fragment"> <strong>Learning from data </strong>(machine learning, pattern
							recognition)</li>
						<li class="fragment"> <strong>Problem-solving and reasoning </strong>(decision-making, planning)
						</li>
						<li class="fragment"> <strong>Perception </strong>(recognizing images, sounds, objects)</li>
						<li class="fragment"><strong>Interaction </strong>(robots, self-driving cars, recommendation
							systems)</li>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Types of AI</h3>
				</section>
				<section>
					<ul>
						<li><strong> Narrow AI:</strong> AI designed for a specific task (e.g., Siri, Google Translate,
							Netflix recommendations).</li>
						<li class="fragment"><strong> General AI:</strong> A more advanced form that could, in theory,
							perform any
							intellectual task a human can (this doesn’t exist yet).</li>
						<li class="fragment"><strong> Superintelligent AI:</strong> A hypothetical future AI that

					<h2>1. The Dawn of Computing and AI's Birth (1939-1950)</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>1939: Alan Turing and the First Computer</h3>
				</section>
				<section>
					<ul>
						<li>The world faced technological warfare with the <strong> Nazis' Enigma machine</strong>, an
							"unbreakable" encryption device.</li>
						<li class="fragment">Alan Turing, a visionary mathematician, developed the first computer to
							break
							the Enigma code.</li>
						<li class="fragment">This machine became the bedrock for the modern Digital World, redefining
							warfare
							and starting the era of computing.</li>
						<li class="fragment">Turing questioned, "can machines think?" and was convinced they could and
							would perform
							human-like tasks.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>1946-1947: The Need for Efficiency and the Semiconductor</h3>
				</section>
				<section>
					<ul>
						<li>By 1946, the military recognized computers' power but found them inefficient due to
							large vacuum tubes.</li>
						<li class="fragment">Computers were "the size of a warehouse" and required "manual labor to
							maintain".
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">In 1947, physicist Bill Shockley imagined powering computers with
							<strong>germanium</strong>
							to create a semiconductor, acting like an "electrical switch".
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">This became the transistor, promising to shrink computing power to "the
							size of a
							fingertip," fueling ideas of "super powerful computers exhibiting artificial
							intelligence".</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>1950: The Turing Test</h3>
				</section>
				<section>
					<ul>
						<li>Alan Turing introduced the <strong>Imitation Game</strong>, or <strong>Turing Test</strong>,
							to determine if a
							machine could "exhibit intelligent Behavior indistinguishable from that of a human".
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">This "fundamentally questioned the limits of artificial and human
							intelligence" and
							"etched" AI's power into the human psyche.</li>
						<li class="fragment">Top universities like Harvard, MIT, and Princeton began offering computer
							science
							degrees due to this fascination.</li>
					</ul>

				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>1950s: Marvin Minsky and the First Neuronet</h3>
				</section>
				<section>
					<ul>
						<li>Inspired by Turing, Marvin Minsky, a 23-year-old PhD candidate at Princeton
							University, built the world's first working neuronet.</li>
						<li>It used wires and "six vacuum tubes as the synapses," laying the "foundation for the
							field of artificial intelligence and the bay Rock that's the neural network".</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>1954-1956: Shockley Semiconductor and the "Traitorous Eight"</h3>
				</section>
				<section>
					<ul>
						<li>The success of the transistor radio led Bill Shockley to leave Bell Labs and start
							Shockley Semiconductor in Palo Alto in 1954.</li>
						<li>He recruited 12 brilliant minds, including Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce.</li>
						<li>In 1956, eight of these recruits, dubbed the "Traitorous Eight" by Shockley,
							defected to form Fairchild Semiconductor.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<ul>
						<li>Fairchild quickly became profitable by selling 100 silicon-based transistors to IBM
							for the B70 bomber's navigation system, proving silicon's superiority over germanium.
						</li>
						<li>Silicon-based transistors offered a 30 times larger profit margin.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Fairchild's Innovations: Planar Process and Integrated Circuit</h3>
				</section>
				<section>
					<ul>
						<li>John Hoerni, a physicist at Fairchild, invented the planar process, a more
							efficient manufacturing method that added a protective coating to transistors for
							"stability and durability". Fairchild held the profitable patent.</li>
						<li>The industry faced a "stalemate" as transistors could only "do one thing at a time" [9].
						</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<ul>
						<li>Bob Noyce, leader of Fairchild, created the integrated circuit, allowing
							"transistors to operate together in unison like a network". (Note: Jack Kilby at
							Texas Instruments technically created it first, but Noyce's version was superior).
						</li>
						<li>This led to a "mass Exodus" of Fairchild employees, forming the "Fairchildren"
							(e.g., LSI Logic, AMD, Intel), which today power "over 92% of the world's computing
							power".</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>1966: Eliza, the World's First Chatbot</h3>
				</section>
				<section>
					<ul>
						<li>Joseph Weizenbaum, an MIT computer scientist, created Eliza, the "world's
							first
							chatbot," on an IBM 794 computer.</li>
						<li>Inspired by Minsky's neuronet, Eliza used "pattern matching and substitution" to
							simulate conversations, giving users "the illusion of understanding".</li>

							cheap enough to sit on the desk".</li>
						<li>This innovation paved the way for companies like Microsoft and Apple in the late
							1970s, which "laid the groundwork for modern Computing" and the PC boom of the 80s
							and
							early 90s.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

							"cornerstone for all neuron Nets".</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>1997: IBM Deep Blue and the AI Formula</h3>
				</section>
				<section>
					<ul>

							of games played, and combined it with brw Force computing power," defeated the
							world's
							best chess player.</li>
